# Changelog

# [1.5.0](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/compare/v1.4.1...v1.5.0) (2022-03-16)


### Bug Fixes

* Adds grpc server to client EPS. Still not reachable from outside, but necessary for communication between health departments. ([679c08e](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/679c08e13ed2e40fe2bcbf8be486f50641e31af5)), closes [#637](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/637)
* Fixes an error when changing user data (IllegalStateException: Cannot convert value of type 'java.lang.String' […] no matching editors or conversion strategy found). ([58b3d42](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/58b3d425f71098f53ab54e52fea51cad2ccc9e10))


### Features

* Adds a hint to search for hd-contacts by postal code or city into the message input frontend. ([032a648](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/032a6482d9e43b426b34b3ff3dff25ca53c77fc9)), closes [#632](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/632) [#636](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/636)
* Displays meta-data (who and when created/last modified an entity) on event-tracking, index-tracking and user detail pages. ([da1b7a6](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/da1b7a66097d864e6ab0f93b296d1476675b19c8)), closes [iris-connect/iris-backlog#234](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-backlog/issues/234) [#638](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/638)
* **Docker Compose:** Adds scope labels to the services in the Docker Compose file to avoid conflicts with possibly existing other instances of Watchtower on the same Docker host. ([499267f](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/499267f05d61e74a0100649be80863a0bb508563)), closes [#666](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/666)
* **Messages:** Uses `_ping` and the EPS version check when building the recipient list to determine if a health department is able to receive messages. This avoids additional configuration and enables faster propagation of the feature. ([446da17](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/446da176fa26cc3dd81151048b6133a30e964b54)), closes [#668](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/668)
* **vaccination report:** Apps connected to EPS can announce the submission of a vaccination report via the JSON-RPC method `announceVaccinationInfoList`. A transmission channel is then opened briefly for the respective user of the app. ([c38078a](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/c38078a4aadc98d14fb6e4995aab34a312cc3279)), closes [iris-connect/iris-backlog#273](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-backlog/issues/273) [#635](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/635)

* D-Trust root certificates were missing and are now included in docker-images ([7ea894a](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/7ea894a579979861b36d1c5651cacf60a2a39ea2))

# [1.3.0](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/compare/v1.2.1...v1.3.0) (2022-02-01)


### Bug Fixes

* Avoids irrelevant but logged ClassNotFoundException. It is correct that the class iris.backend_service.configurations.CentralConfigurationException is missing. ([89c2da8](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/89c2da81bc1b009e10026a1d9802386ad3f6a2de)), closes [#527](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/527)

* Changes the certificate paths to the new schema introduced with new EPS. ([fe1a0b3](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/fe1a0b3c89abb306f178e88f963881c684b36540))
* Cleans the `.env(.sample)` from values that are prescribed for the environments. Admins in the HDs do not have to do anything with it now, instead the correct values are set internally based on the `IRIS_ENV`. ([0211219](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/0211219f794160f294664f27e77452dbe4bc0a53)), closes [#566](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/566)
* **Deps:** Sets new log4j version to fix current vulnerability in versions ≤2.17.0 ([c57d32f](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/c57d32ff1907124e6466b32f5fba5331fa74596f))
* from version 0.22.0 Trivy scans POMs and disables JAR detection ([ce5f37b](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/ce5f37b4be3183bfdf87ba23b5348029d9a7b1ed))
* ignores vulnerability with unclear reason ([5fdc9db](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/5fdc9dbf95bbf36fab44d9485f9a820554a635d9))
* Removes a few default values for configurations that do not work in general, but hide the lack of an individual configuration. If the `.env(.sample)` has been filled in according to the notes it contains, then all mandatory values are already set correctly and no action is required. ([c61dc00](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/c61dc00cd179361b158ea625d7a749c386bb1399)), closes [#561](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/561)
* Removes the long deprecated environment variable TRUSTED_CA_CRT from `.env.sample`. This has not had any effect for some time. ([1e19b7e](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/1e19b7ea62f48f87999b78cf7d73037e6f22a6ee)), closes [#554](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/554) [#555](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/555)
* Stack traces are not included in error responses now to avoid giving too many internal details to the outside world for error conditions. ([07c6476](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/07c647615acb9581f2a71f8442554f5bdf05a2db)), closes [#560](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/560)
* **Standalone installation:** The announcement database file is now relative to the execution path by default and can be additionally configured with ANNOUNCEMENT_DB_FOLDER. ([f9e5bf9](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/f9e5bf91b60a10a8d533e61d2dc26502ff05b196)), closes [#222](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/222) [#528](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/528)
* The property `SECURITY_JWT_SHARED_SECRET` is now deprecated and is no longer considered. Instead, the secret is set randomly. This relieves the administrators of the IRIS client from this technically necessary detail. ([1bfe801](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/1bfe801dcc4637aa5a8fc8d9f14c9e3362813b8a)), closes [#553](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/553) [#556](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/556)

* **Codescan:** adds more queries to the CodeQL scan to be more helpful ([8fb828c](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/8fb828c4e5b7ab1adf275195c39fbeb7ffaeef1f))
* **Database:** Updates the integrated PostgreSQL database (Docker-Compose installation) to the version `13.5`. ([60ed899](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/60ed8995745cf4a51a92ce9961b134f7c1fe3dff)), closes [#540](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/540)

This script runs together with 'start-iris-client-bff.sh'. ([ed691f8](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/ed691f8ee801e59601cfbb13fbfaca68012b78a8)), closes [iris-connect/iris-backlog#226](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-backlog/issues/226) [#586](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/586)
* The certificate of the local EPS is validated by the IRIS Client now. This will further improve security within the health department installation. ([870ae47](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/870ae4747980039c19284c8b6142562b2f7840a3)), closes [iris-connect/iris-backlog#226](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-backlog/issues/226) [#568](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/568)
* To protect against flooding with very large amounts of data, submissions is now limited. This concerns both the pure amount of data and the number of elements per data submission. ([7733fe8](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/7733fe84d91480512d3e1a1a479d6cdadfb04a4a)), closes [iris-backlog/issues#180](https://github.com/iris-backlog/issues/issues/180) [#573](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/573)

* Cleans the `.env(.sample)` from values that are prescribed for the environments. Admins in the HDs do not have to do anything with it now, instead the correct values are set internally based on the `IRIS_ENV`. ([0211219](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/0211219f794160f294664f27e77452dbe4bc0a53)), closes [#566](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/566)

* from version 0.22.0 Trivy scans POMs and disables JAR detection ([ce5f37b](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/ce5f37b4be3183bfdf87ba23b5348029d9a7b1ed))
* ignores vulnerability with unclear reason ([5fdc9db](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/5fdc9dbf95bbf36fab44d9485f9a820554a635d9))
* Removes a few default values for configurations that do not work in general, but hide the lack of an individual configuration. If the `.env(.sample)` has been filled in according to the notes it contains, then all mandatory values are already set correctly and no action is required. ([c61dc00](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/c61dc00cd179361b158ea625d7a749c386bb1399)), closes [#561](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/561)
* Removes the long deprecated environment variable TRUSTED_CA_CRT from `.env.sample`. This has not had any effect for some time. ([1e19b7e](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/1e19b7ea62f48f87999b78cf7d73037e6f22a6ee)), closes [#554](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/554) [#555](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/555)

([07c6476](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/07c647615acb9581f2a71f8442554f5bdf05a2db)), closes [#560](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/560)
* **Standalone installation:** The announcement database file is now relative to the execution path by default and can be additionally configured with ANNOUNCEMENT_DB_FOLDER. ([f9e5bf9](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/f9e5bf91b60a10a8d533e61d2dc26502ff05b196)), closes [#222](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/222) [#528](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/528)
* The property `SECURITY_JWT_SHARED_SECRET` is now deprecated and is no longer considered. Instead, the secret is set randomly. This relieves the administrators of the IRIS client from this technically necessary detail. ([1bfe801](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/1bfe801dcc4637aa5a8fc8d9f14c9e3362813b8a)), closes [#553](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/553) [#556](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/556)

* The certificate of the local EPS is validated by the IRIS Client now. This will further improve security within the health department installation. ([870ae47](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/870ae4747980039c19284c8b6142562b2f7840a3)), closes [iris-connect/iris-backlog#226](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-backlog/issues/226) [#568](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/568)
* To protect against flooding with very large amounts of data, submissions is now limited. This concerns both the pure amount of data and the number of elements per data submission. ([7733fe8](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/commit/7733fe84d91480512d3e1a1a479d6cdadfb04a4a)), closes [iris-backlog/issues#180](https://github.com/iris-backlog/issues/issues/180) [#573](https://github.com/iris-connect/iris-client/issues/573)
